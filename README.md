# Energy Optimization and Scheduling Algorithms for Residential Buildings

## Introduction
The escalating demand for electricity, driven by economic growth, has exposed the inadequacy of traditional power grids. Smart Grids, with bi-directional capabilities, offer a solution by enabling efficient communication between utility providers and consumers. This facilitates Demand Side Management (DSM), including Demand Response (DR) and Load Management, crucial for a responsive electricity distribution system. This report evaluates the performance of three algorithms - Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), Differential Evolution, and Harmony Search - in optimizing energy consumption for residential buildings.

## Related Work
Exploring various Energy Management Systems (EMS), this section reviews studies employing different algorithms. Notable contributions include efficient scheduling of interruptible loads using BPSO, appliance control with metaheuristic algorithms, and optimization of demand response systems through teaching and learning-based algorithms.

## Problem Formulation
The report addresses the challenge of scheduling appliances for curtailment while considering priorities, capacity, and cost. A detailed problem formulation is provided, including appliance properties, hourly curtailment requirements, and priority levels.

## Objective Function and Constraints
A multi-objective function is proposed to balance user comfort, cost reduction, and appliance prioritization. Constraints include minimum on/off durations and a penalty for frequent curtailment of the same appliances.

## Algorithms
The study employs BPSO, Differential Evolution, and Harmony Search algorithms. Each algorithm is detailed, explaining their unique approaches to address the energy optimization problem.

## Results and Discussions
Comparative analysis reveals that BPSO excels in user comfort, cost reduction, and appliance prioritization. Differential Evolution also performs well, while Harmony Search lags behind in multiple aspects. The report includes visualizations, such as hourly curtailment and algorithm runtime comparisons.

## Conclusion
BPSO emerges as the most balanced and effective algorithm, showcasing its potential for energy optimization in residential buildings. The findings emphasize the importance of choosing the right optimization algorithm to achieve the defined objectives. Opportunities for further research and development in electricity consumption management are highlighted.
